The vehicle should learn how to behave by producing outputs to every input it receives. The model can be trained based traffic sign samples and their outputs so that it learns how the function mapping."

    "d.) This is a simulation problem where the model is known and inputs are known as well. We want to use the model to produce an output. In part a.) we use modelling to train the model how to recognize traffic signs. However, in this case it's a simulation scenario where we are testing how our model functions/behaves and its accuracy in these scenarios. It could also help us understand more what can our current model do and not do in a dynamic environment. "

    "e.) This is a simulation problem where the model is known and inputs are known as well. The model according to the input which is a child running into the road will produce an output which it learns based on a previous modelling problem. We can also simulate this scenario to test our model using a small robot/object that resembles a child to test how our system behaves. We can also use this simulation approach in our modelling to learn the function mapping and train our model but I assume here that the model is already constructed and it's behaving according to the input it's given so it's a simulation problem.

    "2.) Supervised Learning: You have fully labeled data of your training samples meaning you have access to the output classes of your train instances. So your model is trained to learn the weights of your features that will minimize the loss between the model's estimated output and the correct output for every training sample. An example would be classification of cars where each training sample is an image of the car and the output of it is the label of the car. \n",

    "Unsupervised Learning: In this type of learning, the model doesn't know the correct output of the training instances. So the model has to find patterns in the data without knowing the labels of the data. It can learn the organization of the data by clustering for example the training samples into clusters where the samples in a cluster would be more similar to each other than to any other samples in other clusters according to a metric. Another example of an unsupervised learning model would be an autoencoder which takes input data and compresses it then tries to create the input data again from the compressed version of it. An example of clustering would be clustering set of individuals according to some given features. \n",

    "Reinforcement Learning: In this type of learning, the model has to make a decision at every step where the previous decisions influence the decision at that step. The decision at the current step also  influences the next input you will get. In reinforcement learning, the model is learning which behaviors to reward and which behaviors to punish and it does that dynamically. An example would be teaching a robot how to walk in a coordinate space."

    "a.) Training dataset consists of the training samples the model uses to learn how to map sample features to their output class. This dataset consists of features for every training sample along with the correct class output of the sample. The model uses these trained samples to fit its weights to minimize the loss between the model's estimated output and the correct output for the training samples. Test dataset consist of labeled test samples with the correct output but however aren't used to train the model. These test samples are given to the model as input to the model learned from the training samples. The model's estimated output on the test samples is compared to the correct class outputs of the test datasets to see how well it can generalize to unseen data and measure the accuracy of generalization according to some metric.\n",

    "b.) Training data: 80 percent of the 10,000 samples, so 8,000 samples. Testing data 10 percent of the 10,000 samples, so 1,000 samples. Validation data 10 percent of the 10,000 samples, so 1,000 samples. \n",

    "c.) Cross validation helps in avoiding overfitting your model to the data .. learning the parameters of a model to predict a take should always happen in a dataset (training) that is different that the test data used to evaluate your model. Learning and testing on the same data would create a model that is not generalizable on unseen data  causing overfitting. \n",
